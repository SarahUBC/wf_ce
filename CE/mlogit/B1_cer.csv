Denmark has smaller turbines up since 1991, that's not long enough to know the impacts, nor is it necessarily a good guide to use for turbines that will be much larger.   /  / I will always opt for the solution that does NOT mess with the ocean life at all.  That is why I consistently chose C.  We can find cleaner ways to use coal and natural gas.  Let's not decide to just waltz off and potentially destroy yet another part of this world.  We've done enough to the oceans...we need to just stop.   /  / Another alternative, that no one likes to talk about much is:  work on ways to stop using so many resources.  Thing is, no one wants to be in the slightest bit inconvenienced to do that.  Ride a bike?  Here's the list of excuses as to why that's not possible....is what you will get in response.  Of course the winter time is ridiculously cold and i wouldn't ride a bike in that weather, either, but what about the other six months of the year?   /  / We have to decide if we want to mess up our oceans, or realize that burning wood isn't as bad as its made out to be, when it comes to heating homes.  We need to stop using so much oil to heat homes in the winter time.  Natural gas is a better solution in that case, and if we set up to use natural gas to heat homes, then we can use natural gas for other things, making wind turbines unnecessary.   /  / If no one wants turbines in their backyard, (which is the whole reason they would be out in the ocean), then they don't belong in the ocean, either.  I swear people as a ""community"" are incredibly selfish.  Let's go ahead and possibly destroy the ocean just so we don't have to look at some ugly monstrosity, (except when we go to the beach....which is another topic in itself to have to see those hideous things out there when looking out on the ocean), and because we think it's better to destroy yet another environment when we've done a bang up job of trashing the land that we live on.
